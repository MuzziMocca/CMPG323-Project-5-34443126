This repository contains the Reporting and Monitoring project and itâ€™s resources. In this project I have created a report using Microsoft Power BI Deskop called Connected Office - Device Monitoring. This report is based on the data collected from a local excel file on my computer containing Connected Office data.
# The Use Of Connected Office - Device Monitoring
Using this report is not that complicated but users will have to own an account on Power BI official website and then can they be able to access my report.

The report is made up of three main pages, High-Level Metrics; Device Monitoring and Devices Registered, respectively. The last page is called Filtering and will be used to filter the whole report. Power BI is a very greate reporting tool which uses relationships of data, thus graphs are also relation. Using this advantage, stakeholders will be able to analyze and filter through the visualizations created on the pages to yield results that will help in decision making.

The report will also be committed in this repository to allow another shared access, it can then be downloaded and used in many different ways that support good decision making.
